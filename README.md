# The Lullabot Breakroom in VR
Lullabot's first VR website. Visit in [janusVR](http://janusvr.com/) >>> http://lullabot.github.io/lb_breakroom/

## Viewing
To view this site properly, you need the janusVR 3D web browser. Go to http://janusvr.com/, click the download link, and choose the client for your OS.

Upon first launching the browser you will be taken to the default website which is called the Lobby. From here you can walk around and click on various other portals to explore even further. Here are some of the basic controls:

### Movement
* Hit `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` to move around.
* Hit `f` to enter flight mode. Look where you want to fly and hit `w`, `a`, `s`, `d` to move.

### Navigation
* Left click on any portal to open and just walk through.
* Hit `tab` to create your own portal. A textbox will appear with the ability to type in any url you want. If the website you choose does not have janusML, a default room will be generated with the 2D version of the website presented on the walls.

### Communication
* Hit `t` to text chat.
* Hit `c` to open up the chat log. You can scroll this with your mouse wheel or trackpad.
* To voice chat with the **janusVR community**, download the Mumble client and connect to

* The janusVR community also communicates asychronously via the [janusVR subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/janusVR/).
